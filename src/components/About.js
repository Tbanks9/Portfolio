                  <p>I developed an interest in programming after spending time working alongside software engineers in my last role. I began learning front-end languages in my spare time, and my programming journey truly kicked-off when I enrolled in an immersive course at General Assembly, learning a variety of new programming languages and frameworks.</p>
                  <p>Iâ€™m continuing to learn every day, and love getting stuck into daily challenges. I'm excited to bring this passion to a junior full-stack position, where I can continue improving and apply my skills as a programmer.</p>
